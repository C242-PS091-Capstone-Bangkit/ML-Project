# Machine Learning Project - Google Colab Implementation ðŸš€

This project demonstrates a machine learning workflow using Google Colab and datasets stored in Google Drive.

## Requirements
The project uses the following libraries:
- `os`
- `pickle`
- `random`
- `numpy`
- `tensorflow`
- `matplotlib`
- `ipywidgets`
- `sklearn`
- `torchvision`

Ensure that these libraries are installed before running the project.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Prepare the Dataset
1. **Upload the Dataset to Google Drive**:  
   - Place the dataset folder in the `My Drive` section of your Google Drive.  
   - For example, if dataset folder is named `dataset`, its path should look like this:  
     ```
     /content/drive/My Drive/dataset
     ```

2. **Mount Google Drive in Colab**:  
   Add the following code to your notebook to mount Google Drive:  
   ```python
   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive')
   dataset_path = '/content/drive/My Drive/dataset'

### 2. Open the Project in Google Colab
1. Visit Google Colab and open a new notebook.
2. Upload the `.ipynb` file for this project to Colab environment.

### 3. Install Required Libraries
