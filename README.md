# Machine Learning Project - Model Implementation 🚀

This project demonstrates a machine learning workflow using Google Colab and datasets stored in Google Drive.
The Skin Type and Skin Condition model is built both from scratch and using transfer learning with the **InceptionV3** pretrained model. **The fixed model used in this capstone project is the InceptionV3 model due to its superior accuracy compared to other models.**

## Requirements📋
The project uses the following libraries:
- `os`
- `pickle`
- `random`
- `numpy`
- `tensorflow`
- `matplotlib`
- `ipywidgets`
- `sklearn`
- `torchvision`

Ensure that these libraries are installed before running the project.

## Setup Instructions⚙️

### 1. Prepare the Dataset
1. **Upload the Dataset to Google Drive**📥:  
   - Place the dataset folder in the `My Drive` section of your Google Drive.  
   - For example, if dataset folder is named `dataset`, its path should look like this:  
     ```
     /content/drive/My Drive/dataset
     ```

2. **Mount Google Drive in Colab**🔗:  
   Add the following code to your notebook to mount Google Drive:  
   ```python
   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive')
   dataset_path = '/content/drive/My Drive/dataset'


### 2. Open the Project in Google Colab🌐
- Visit Google Colab and open a new notebook.
- Upload the `.ipynb` file for this project to Colab environment.


### 3. Install Required Libraries🧰


### 4. Pre-Process The Dataset📸
- **Load images from the dataset folder**: Use the path specified earlier to load images.
- **Split the dataset into training and validation dataset**
- **Dataset Augmentation**: To improve model performance and reduce overfitting, augment the dataset with transformations such as rotation, flipping, scaling, or color adjustments.


### 5. Build and Train The Model 🏋️‍♂️
- Define the machine learning model using TensorFlow
- Train the model using the prepared dataset.


### 6. Evaluate the Model📊
Evaluate the performance of the trained model using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, or classification report. Follow the evaluation steps provided in the notebook.


### 7. Additional Notes📝
Use GPU runtime in Colab for faster computation:
- Go to Runtime > Change runtime type.
- Select GPU as the hardware accelerator.
